## Vectors

```{r}
# Create a vector
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie")

#Check the class (can be done in console if you don't want this to show up)
class(dogs)
#character
```

```{r}
cats <- c("creamsicle wolf", 14.2, 3L)

class(cats)
#character because character is most flexible
```

```{r}
years <- c(20, 40, 16, 2)
class(years)
#numeric

typeof(years)
#double subtype of numeric
```

```{r}
# Want to do a conditional check
# is. <<< asks questions 'is this THIS"
# as. <<< gives a command "makes this THIS"

is.numeric(years)
is.character(years)

# Is the years vector a numeric? Is the years vector a character?
```

```{r}
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast")

dog_food

dog_food[2]

dog_food["khora"]
```
